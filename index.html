        For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a tinkerer. Taking things apart and putting them back 
        together again - the thrill of seeing something you’ve built yourself working the way you want
        it to - was a source of endless fascination for me as a kid, and it continues to drive my interests
        in computing and mathematics today. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My passions are rooted in that childhood tinkering, but my experience with theatre in high school 
        has been a driving force in my views of the importance of arts in parallel with science and technology; 
        I’ll forever be a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics) evangelist, and in an 
        age where the moral and ethical implications of automation and machine learning are so prominent, 
        a solid background in humanities is essentially in developing ethical software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since I started tutoring professionally a year and a half ago, I’ve developed a major passion 
        for math education, and I hope to dive into the world of educational technology to equip other teachers 
        with more powerful tools for helping students visualize and grasp mathematical concepts.
